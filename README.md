## Introduction

# The Project
Every dog owner knows the struggle of moving in a new place and not knowing anyone else with a dog. But our dogs need to socialize too! This is why we created PuppR.

PuppR is a dating site for dogs! Dog owners can create a profile for their pup, and start swiping through other dogs in their area. If they want to meet a dog, they can "like" their profile, and if that dog likes them back, it's a match! From there, the two users can decide to contact each other and organize a playdate for their dogs. If they don't like that dog, they can just "pass" it.

Other features include: editing the dog's profile, modifying the user settings, a "previous" button to see the previous profile again.

# The Context
This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at Holberton School. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.

# The Team
We are three dog enthusiasts who are passionate about coding but also like to keep it fun!
